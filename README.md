# Recreating Google's Homepage
## an introductory to HTML and CSS project for The Odin Project fundamentals course.

Recreated with a mobile-first approach using just HTML and CSS to match the
style and layout of the Google Homepage as of June 2021. Although google uses the user
agent to show a different flavour of the webpage, I went for classic media
queries using min-width.

What I learnt:
- How to rename branch in git: `git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>`

What I had difficulties with:
- Applying a style to the parent if the child had focus (searchbar). (I managed
  to do this with JavaScript)
- Getting a sub-menu to pop up (more nav on results page)
