## This is a mini intrudoctory to HTML and CSS project for The Odin Project fundamentals course.

I have tried to recreate the google homepage using git version control while building the project.

Some elements are missing (such as the maginfying glass in search box, country info in footer) but all in all it doesn't look far off.

The media queries aren't perfect, resising the window doesn't feel the same as google.com

Please let me know what I could improve at this early stage in my learning path. I'm open to all suggestions.
